- Console
> *Automatically displays built-in Unity Logs & offers a manual way of executing commands*
- Console Autofill
> *Suggestions based on what you have typed will appear, pressing LEFT ALT will cycle options, pressing tab will autofill based on selection.*
> *This also describes any extra command parameters*
- GUI Panel
> *All commands get automatically parsed into submenus & buttons to be easily accessed through the UI, maintaining full functionality*
- On-Screen Widgets
> *Easily add custom UI prefabs to the screen at any moment which persist across all scenes with 10 different anchor points.*
- Release Stripping
> *All debugging features become fully inacessible upon making a non-development build. No changes need to be made on your end to ensure the end-user cannot access your tools.*
- Automatic Deployment
> *No prefabs, scripts, or setup is needed for this framework to function, simply import the package to your project and enter playmode. Works in any scene & persists through destructive loading.*
